9. Docker setup for Railway Deployment

[ v2 ] Project Notifier Publisher/Subscriber

Based on your answers and current setup, here is a clear, step-by-step roadmap tailored for your specific Railway project deployment to follow best practices and get your endpoints working reliably:

Organize your GitHub repo structure

Set up Railway services one by one

Configure service environment variables in Railway

Set correct start commands

Configure Railway networking

Push your repo and deploy

Test endpoints via Railway’s public URL for the Nginx service

This approach avoids mixing all containers in a single Railway deployment, opts for individual services with clear isolated build contexts, and uses Railway’s private networking and variable referencing for intra-service communication.

It allows you to keep developing locally using your current docker-compose stack, while enabling seamless multi-service deployment on Railway via one GitHub repo source without extra pipelines.

Keep all your container source folders (e.g.,

Each folder should have its own

In Railway, create a

For each Railway service, connect to the

For example:

Nginx service → Dockerfile in

PHP-FPM service → Dockerfile in

Laravel utility → Dockerfile in

MySQL → Dockerfile in

React → Dockerfile in

Copy your local

Use Railway’s

For PHP-FPM container, default start should be running

For Nginx, run Nginx normally (usually default CMD).

For Laravel queue worker service, set start to appropriate

React service typically runs

Use

Adjust Nginx config to proxy requests to Railway’s PHP-FPM private domain and port.

Expose only the Nginx service publicly, as that is your HTTP entry point.

Once the above is configured, push to GitHub.

Each Railway service builds and deploys independently but shares the repo as source, building from their respective Dockerfiles.

Railway will handle builds and deployments for each service separately.

Confirm your Laravel endpoints respond correctly through Nginx.
